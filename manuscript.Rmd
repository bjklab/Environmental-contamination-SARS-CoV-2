### Introduction:    
  
Despite infection control measures, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been observed in the healthcare and hospital settings. In a recent study of SARS-CoV-2-infected and -uninfected patients inadvertently roomed together, 39% of exposed uninfected patients developed COVID-19. Risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission was associated with source patients who had low cycle threshold (Ct), i.e., high viral load, in their diagnostic testing [@Karan2021-cm].  
 
SARS-CoV-2 transmission can be mediated by droplets, aerosols, or fomites. Prior studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 extensively contaminates surfaces in the healthcare environment [@Morawska2021-mv]. But the spatial extent of contamination -- and how contamination changes during the course of hospitalization -- remain less well understood [@Mody2021-ag].  

We have previously applied spatial mapping and systematic sampling to define how multidrug-resistant organisms cluster in the hospital environment [site pending ICHE manuscript]. We now extend the methods we have developed to understand how SARS-CoV-2 contamination is distributed spatially, and how it changes over time.

### Materials and Methods:  
  
* __Study Design, Setting, and Population__: We performed a prospective cohort study at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP), an academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA, USA. (IRB protocol #8).   
  
* __Causal Model__: We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 contamination would decay with physical distance from patient and with time from COVID-19 diagnosis. We also hypothesized that high-touch objects would be more frequently contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA than low-touch objects.     
  
* __Specimen Collection and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR__:    
   
* __Distance Data Collection__: Distances from the environmental sampling site to the patient bed was recorded using a laser measuring device (Bosch GLM 20). Researchers positioned the laser measure at the head of the bed within the room and recorded distances to the in-room ...      
  
* __Definition of Exposures and Outcomes__:         
  
* __Statistical Methods__: Data were organized using R statistical software version 3.6.1 [@R_Core_Team2018-xo], and plots generated using the “ggplot2” package [@Wickham2016-eh]. We examined how (1) distance from the patient and (2) time since COVID-19 diagnosis relate to the probability of SARS-CoV-2 detection using a binomial model with a logit link. We also evaluated mixed-effects model incorporating a random effect for subjects to account for clustering of longitudinal data, and to evaluate inter-subject differences. Models were fit using Stan Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) version 2.21, via the "brms" package with default, weakly-informative priors [@Carpenter2017-ec; @Burkner2017-yr]. Prior predictive modeling was performed, and models were fit with 4 chains of 1000 iterations, confirmed with HMC diagnostics (no divergent iterations, Rhat statistic < 1.1 for all parameters, and E-BFMI > 0.2) [@McElreath2016-sf; @Gabry2019-le; @Gelman2020-sd]. We examined parameter distributions at 50%, 80%, and 95% posterior credible intervals to understand the relationship between exposure and outcome variables.
