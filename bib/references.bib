              covariance structures, censored data, as well as meta-analytic
              standard errors. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly
              encourage users to apply prior distributions that actually
              reflect their beliefs. In addition, model fit can easily be
              assessed and compared with the Watanabe-Akaike information

              to profile microbial communities. New long-read sequencing
              technologies can sequence the entire 16S rRNA gene, but higher
              error rates have limited their attractiveness when accuracy is
              important. Here we present a high-throughput amplicon sequencing
              methodology based on PacBio circular consensus sequencing and the
              DADA2 sample inference method that measures the full-length 16S

              rate. In two artificial communities of known composition, our
              method recovered the full complement of full-length 16S sequence
              variants from expected community members without residual errors.
              The measured abundances of intra-genomic sequence variants were
              in the integral ratios expected from the genuine allelic variants
              within a genome. The full-length 16S gene sequences recovered by
              our approach allowed Escherichia coli strains to be correctly
              classified to the O157:H7 and K12 sub-species clades. In human
              fecal samples, our method showed strong technical replication and
              was able to recover the full complement of 16S rRNA alleles in
              several E. coli strains. There are likely many applications
              beyond microbial profiling for which high-throughput amplicon

               Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov
               chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an
               adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized

               methods such as the limited memory
               Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a
               platform for computing log densities and their gradients and
               Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as
               variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal
               inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is

              $\vartheta$1− $\vartheta$2) is calibrated using the Type 1 error
              rate, relying on the assumption that the true difference is zero,
              which makes no sense in many applications. We set up a more
              relevant framework in which a true comparison can be positive or
              negative, and, based on the data, you can state ``$\vartheta$1 >
              $\vartheta$2 with confidence,'' ``$\vartheta$2 > $\vartheta$1
              with confidence,'' or ``no claim with confidence.'' We focus on
              the Type S (for sign) error, which occurs when you claim
              ``$\vartheta$1 > $\vartheta$2 with confidence'' when
              $\vartheta$2> $\vartheta$1 (or vice-versa). We compute the Type S
              error rates for classical and Bayesian confidence statements and
              find that classical Type S error rates can be extremely high (up
              to 50\%). Bayesian confidence statements are conservative, in the
              sense that claims based on 95\% posterior intervals have Type S
              error rates between 0 and 2.5\%. For multiple comparison

                   Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to

                   using these models, along with many remaining challenges in
                   computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world
                   problems requires not only statistical skills, subject
                   matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the

               potential pathogens in isolation. To develop a community-level
               understanding of how microorganisms colonize and move through
               the hospital environment, we characterized the bacterial
               dynamics among hospital surfaces, patients, and staff over the
               course of 1 year as a new hospital became operational. The
               bacteria in patient rooms, particularly on bedrails,
               consistently resembled the skin microbiota of the patient
               occupying the room. Bacterial communities on patients and room
               surfaces became increasingly similar over the course of a
               patient's stay. Temporal correlations in community structure
               demonstrated that patients initially acquired room-associated
               taxa that predated their stay but that their own microbial
               signatures began to influence the room community structure over
               time. The $\alpha$- and $\beta$-diversity of patient skin
               samples were only weakly or nonsignificantly associated with
               clinical factors such as chemotherapy, antibiotic usage, and
               surgical recovery, and no factor except for ambulatory status
               affected microbial similarity between the microbiotas of a
               patient and their room. Metagenomic analyses revealed that genes
               conferring antimicrobial resistance were consistently more
               abundant on room surfaces than on the skin of the patients
               inhabiting those rooms. In addition, persistent unique genotypes
               of Staphylococcus and Propionibacterium were identified. Dynamic
               Bayesian network analysis suggested that hospital staff were
               more likely to be a source of bacteria on the skin of patients
               than the reverse but that there were no universal patterns of
               transmission across patient rooms.",

               today's model-based statistics, the book pushes readers to
               perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated.

  abstract  = "There is great disparity in the way we think about and address
               different sources of environmental infection. Governments have
               for decades promulgated a large amount of legislation and
               invested heavily in food safety, sanitation, and drinking water
               for public health purposes. By contrast, airborne pathogens and
               respiratory infections, whether seasonal influenza or COVID-19,
               are addressed fairly weakly, if at all, in terms of regulations,
               standards, and building design and operation, pertaining to the
               air we breathe. We suggest that the rapid growth in our
               understanding of the mechanisms behind respiratory infection
               transmission should drive a paradigm shift in how we view and
               address the transmission of respiratory infections to protect
               against unnecessary suffering and economic losses. It starts
               with a recognition that preventing respiratory infection, like
               reducing waterborne or foodborne disease, is a tractable
               problem. Two factors in particular may contribute to our
               relatively weak approach to fighting airborne transmission of
               infectious diseases compared to waterborne and foodborne
               transmission. First, it is much harder to trace airborne
               infections. Food and water contamination nearly always come from
               an easily identifiable point source with a discrete reservoir,
               such as a pipe, well, or package of food. Its impact on human
               health is early if not immediate in terms of characteristic
               signs and symptoms, so that diligent epidemiology can track and
               identify the source relatively easily. Over the years, this has
               led to the current public health structures in well-resourced
               countries. Standards have been enacted for all aspects of food
               and water processing, as well as wastewater and sewage. Public
               health officials, environmental health officers, and local
               councils are trained in surveillance, sampling, and
               investigation of clusters of potential food and waterborne
               outbreaks, often alerted by local microbiology laboratories.
               There are published infection rates for a large range of
               pathogens, with morbidity and mortality risks now well
               established. By contrast, airborne studies are much more
               difficult to conduct because air as a contagion medium is
               nebulous, widespread, not owned by anybody, and uncontained.
               Buildings and their airflows are complicated, and measurement
               methods for such studies are complex and not generally
               standardized. Second, a long-standing misunderstanding and lack
               of research into airborne transmission of pathogens has
               negatively affected recognition of the importance of this route
               ([ 1 ][1]). Most modern building construction has occurred
               subsequent to a decline in the belief that airborne pathogens
               are important. Therefore, the design and construction of modern
               buildings make few if any modifications for this airborne risk
               (other than for specialized medical, research, or manufacturing
               facilities, for example). Respiratory outbreaks have been
               repeatedly ``explained away'' by invoking droplet transmission
               or inadequate hand hygiene. For decades, the focus of architects
               and building engineers was on thermal comfort, odor control,
               perceived air quality, initial investment cost, energy use, and
               other performance issues, whereas infection control was
               neglected. This could in part be based on the lack of perceived
               risk or on the assumption that there are more important ways to
               control infectious disease, despite ample evidence that healthy
               indoor environments with a substantially reduced pathogen count
               are essential for public health. It is now known that
               respiratory infections are caused by pathogens emitted through
               the nose or mouth of an infected person and transported to a
               susceptible host. The pathogens are enclosed in fluid-based
               particles aerosolized from sites in the respiratory tract during
               respiratory activities such as breathing, speaking, sneezing,
               and coughing. The particles encompass a wide size range, with
               most in the range of submicrometers to a few micrometers ([ 1
               ][1]). Although the highest exposure for an individual is when
               they are in close proximity, community outbreaks for COVID-19
               infection in particular most frequently occur at larger
               distances through inhalation of airborne virus--laden particles
               in indoor spaces shared with infected individuals ([ 2 ][2]).
               Such airborne transmission is potentially the dominant mode of
               transmission of numerous respiratory infections. There is also
               strong evidence on disease transmission---for example, in
               restaurants, ships, and schools---suggesting that the way
               buildings are designed, operated, and maintained influences
               transmission. Yet, before COVID-19, to the best of our
               knowledge, almost no engineering-based measures to limit
               community respiratory infection transmission had been employed
               in public buildings (excluding health care facilities) or
               transport infrastructure anywhere in the world, despite the
               frequency of such infections and the large health burden and
               economic losses they cause ([ 3 ][3]). The key engineering
               measure is ventilation, supported by air filtration and air
               disinfection ([ 4 ][4]). In this context, ventilation includes a
               minimum amount of outdoor air combined with recirculated air
               that is cleaned using effective filtration and disinfection.
               There are ventilation guidelines, standards, and regulations to
               which architects and building engineers must adhere. Their
               objectives are to address the issues of odor, and
               occupant-generated bioeffluents [indicated by the concentrations
               of occupant-generated carbon dioxide (CO2)], by specifying
               minimum ventilation rates and other measures to provide an
               acceptable indoor air quality (IAQ) for most occupants.
               Similarly, there are other guidelines and regulations to ensure
               thermal comfort. To achieve this, the amount of outdoor air
               delivered to indoor spaces is recommended or mandated in terms
               of set values of air change rate per hour, or liters of air per
               person per second. Threshold values of CO2 and a range of indoor
               air temperatures and relative humidity have also been
               prescribed. There are also some health-based indoor air quality
               guidelines. The most important are the World Health Organization
               (WHO) IAQ guidelines, providing values for benzene, carbon
               monoxide, formaldehyde, and other chemicals, based on the
               duration of exposure ([ 5 ][5]). There are, however, no
               ventilation guidelines or standards to specifically control the
               concentration of these pollutants indoors. None of the documents
               provide recommendations or standards for mitigating bacteria or
               viruses in indoor air, originating from human respiratory
               activities. Therefore, it is necessary to reconsider the
               objective of ventilation to also address air pollutants linked
               to health effects and airborne pathogens. One challenge is that
               ventilation rates required to protect against infection
               transmission cannot be derived in the same way as rates for
               other pollutants. First, infection-focused ventilation rates
               must be risk-based rather than absolute, considering pathogen
               emission rates and the infectious dose [for which there exist
               data for a number of diseases, including influenza ([ 6 ][6]),
               severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle
               East respiratory syndrome, tuberculosis, SARS-CoV-2, and
               measles]. There is often limited knowledge of viral emission
               rates, and rates differ depending on the physiology of the
               respiratory tract (which varies with age, for example), the
               stage of the disease, and the type of respiratory activity
               (e.g., speaking, singing, or heavy breathing during exercise).
               The infectious dose may differ depending on the mode of
               transmission. This is well established for influenza A, for
               which the infectious dose is smaller with an aerosol inoculum
               than with nasal instillation ([ 7 ][7]). Some infectious agents
               display ``anisotropy,'' in which the severity of disease varies
               according to the mode of transmission ([ 7 ][7]). Second, future
               ventilation systems with higher airflow rates and that
               distribute clean, disinfected air so that it reaches the
               breathing zone of occupants must be demand controlled and thus
               flexible (see the figure). The ventilation rate will differ for
               different venues according to the activities conducted there
               (e.g., higher ventilation rates for exercising in gyms than for
               resting in movie theaters). There are already models enabling
               assessments of ventilation rates and their effective
               distribution in the occupant microenvironments ([ 8 ][8]), and
               in general this is a rapidly expanding field. Demand control and
               flexibility are necessary not only to control risk but also to
               address other requirements, including the control of indoor air
               pollution originating from inside and outside sources and,
               especially, to control energy use: Ventilation should be made
               adequate on demand but not unreasonably high. Buildings consume
               over one-third of energy globally, much of it expended on
               heating or cooling outdoor air as it is brought indoors.
               Therefore, although building designs should optimize indoor
               environment quality in terms of health and comfort, they should
               do so in an energy-efficient way in the context of local climate
               and outdoor air pollution. ![Figure][9] Flexible ventilation
               systems, dependent on the building's purpose Ventilation airflow
               rates must be controlled by the number of occupants in the space
               and their activity. GRAPHIC: N. CARY/ SCIENCE Third, in some
               settings, it will not be possible to increase ventilation to the
               point of reducing the risk to an acceptable level, regardless of
               the quality of the ventilation system. This refers to individual
               risk of infection for each susceptible occupant, to the event
               reproduction number (the expected number of new infections
               arising from a single infectious occupant at an event), and to
               the reality that ventilation has less of an impact for
               near-field exposure. Management of the event reproduction number
               is important for the control of an epidemic, especially for
               indoor spaces with a high density of people, high emission rate
               (vocalization or exercising), and long periods of shared time.
               Spaces like this will require air-cleaning measures, including
               air filtration and disinfection. Air filtration can be achieved
               by incorporating filters into the building heating, ventilation,
               and air conditioning system or by portable air cleaners, and air
               disinfection can be achieved by using ultraviolet devices ([ 4
               ][4]) while avoiding unproven technologies. The necessity of
               such measures and their effective per-person additional removal
               rate, and thus their efficacy in risk reduction, can be
               incorporated into risk assessment and prospectively modeled.
               None of this means that every indoor space should become a
               biosafety facility. It means that a building should be designed
               and operated according to its purpose and the activities
               conducted there, so that airborne infection risk is maintained
               below an acceptable level. Such measures cannot easily be taken
               during the current pandemic because most building systems have
               not been designed for limiting respiratory infection, building
               owners and operators were not trained to operate the systems
               during the pandemic, and ad hoc measures are often not
               sufficient. Such training, and appropriate measures, should form
               a part of national strategies to prevent the spread of airborne
               diseases and infections. The only types of public buildings
               where airborne infection control exists are health care
               facilities, where requirements for ventilation rates are
               typically much higher than for other public buildings ([ 9
               ][10]). However, although modern hospitals comply with relevant
               standards set to control infection, this may not always be the
               case for some hospitals located in very old buildings. Comparing
               health care ventilation requirements with those for non--health
               care venues suggests that non--health care rates should be
               higher for effective infection control or that more
               recirculation with better filtration should be used. There needs
               to be a shift in the perception that we cannot afford the cost
               of control, because economic costs of infections can be massive
               and may exceed initial infrastructure costs to contain them. The
               global monthly harm from COVID-19 has been conservatively
               assessed at \$1 trillion ([ 10 ][11]), but there are massive
               costs of common respiratory infections as well. In the United
               States alone, the yearly cost (direct and indirect) of influenza
               has been calculated at \$11.2 billion ([ 11 ][12]); for
               respiratory infections other than influenza, the yearly cost
               stood at \$40 billion ([ 12 ][13]). It is not known exactly what
               fraction of infections could be prevented if all building and
               transport ventilation systems on the planet were ideal (in terms
               of controlling airborne infections), or the cost of design and
               retrofitting to make them ideal. However, the airborne
               transmission route is potentially the dominant mode of
               transmission ([ 1 ][1], [ 2 ][2], [ 13 ][14]). Estimates suggest
               that necessary investments in building systems to address
               airborne infections would likely result in less than a 1\%
               increase in the construction cost of a typical building ([ 14
               ][15]). For the vast inventory of existing buildings, although
               economic estimations are more complex, there are numerous
               cost-effective, performance-enhancing solutions to minimize the
               risk of infection transmission. Although detailed economic
               analyses remain to be done, the existing evidence suggests that
               controlling airborne infections can cost society less than it
               would to bear them. The costs of infections are paid from
               different pockets than building and operating costs or health
               care costs, and there is often resistance to higher initial
               expenditure. But ultimately, society pays for all the costs, and
               costs and benefits are never evenly distributed. Investment in
               one part of the system may generate savings in a different part
               of the system, so cross-system reallocation of budgets must be
               facilitated. The benefits extend beyond infectious disease
               transmission. An improvement in indoor air quality may reduce
               absenteeism in the workplace from other, noninfectious causes,
               such as sick building syndrome and allergic reactions, to the
               extent that the reduction in productivity losses may cover the
               cost of any ventilation changes. We encourage several critical
               steps. First and foremost, the continuous global hazard of
               airborne respiratory infection must be recognized so the risk
               can be controlled. This has not yet been universally accepted,
               despite strong evidence to support it and no convincing evidence
               to refute it. Global WHO IAQ guidelines must be extended to
               include airborne pathogens and to recognize the need to control
               the hazard of airborne transmission of respiratory infections.
               This includes recommendations on preventive measures addressing
               all modes of respiratory infection transmission in a proper and
               balanced way, based on state-of-the-art science. The recently
               published WHO Ventilation Roadmap ([ 15 ][16]) is an important
               step but falls short of recognizing the hazard of airborne
               respiratory infection transmission and, in turn, the necessity
               of risk control. National comprehensive IAQ standards must be
               developed, promulgated, and enforced by all countries. Some
               countries have IAQ standards, but none are comprehensive enough
               to include airborne pathogens. In most countries that have IAQ
               standards, there are no enforcement procedures. Most countries
               do not have any IAQ standards. Comprehensive ventilation
               standards must be developed by professional engineering bodies.
               Organizations such as the American Society of Heating,
               Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers and the Federation
               of European Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning
               Associations have ventilation standards, and during the COVID-19
               pandemic, they have proposed building and system-related control
               actions and design improvements to mitigate risk of infection.
               However, standards must be improved to explicitly consider
               infection control in their statements of purpose and
               definitions. New approaches must be developed to encourage
               implementation of standards (e.g., ``ventilation certificates''
               similar to those that exist for food hygiene certification for
               restaurants). Wide use of monitors displaying the state of IAQ
               must be mandated. At present, members of the general public are
               not well aware of the importance of IAQ and have no means of
               knowing the condition of the indoor spaces that they occupy and
               share with others. Sensor technologies exist to display numerous
               parameters characterizing IAQ (most commonly, but not
               exclusively, CO2). Existing IAQ sensor technologies have
               limitations, and more research is needed to develop alternative
               indicator systems. However, visible displays will help keep
               building operators accountable for IAQ and will advance public
               awareness, leading to increased demand for a safe environment.
               The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed how unprepared the world was
               to respond to it, despite the knowledge gained from past
               pandemics. A paradigm shift is needed on the scale that occurred
               when Chadwick's Sanitary Report in 1842 led the British
               government to encourage cities to organize clean water supplies
               and centralized sewage systems. In the 21st century, we need to
               establish the foundations to ensure that the air in our
               buildings is clean with a substantially reduced pathogen count,
               contributing to the building occupants' health, just as we
               expect for the water coming out of our taps.

  abstract      = "This paper discusses predictive inference and feature
                   selection for generalized linear models with scarce but
                   high-dimensional data. We argue that in many cases one can
                   benefit from a decision theoretically justified two-stage
                   approach: first, construct a possibly non-sparse model that
                   predicts well, and then find a minimal subset of features
                   that characterize the predictions. The model built in the
                   first step is referred to as the
                   \textbackslashemph\{reference model\} and the operation
                   during the latter step as predictive
                   \textbackslashemph\{projection\}. The key characteristic of
                   this approach is that it finds an excellent tradeoff between
                   sparsity and predictive accuracy, and the gain comes from
                   utilizing all available information including prior and that
                   coming from the left out features. We review several methods
                   that follow this principle and provide novel methodological
                   contributions. We present a new projection technique that
                   unifies two existing techniques and is both accurate and
                   fast to compute. We also propose a way of evaluating the
                   feature selection process using fast leave-one-out
                   cross-validation that allows for easy and intuitive model
                   size selection. Furthermore, we prove a theorem that helps
                   to understand the conditions under which the projective
                   approach could be beneficial. The benefits are illustrated
                   via several simulated and real world examples.",

                   other shrinkage priors",
  author        = "Piironen, Juho and Vehtari, Aki",
  abstract      = "The horseshoe prior has proven to be a noteworthy
                   alternative for sparse Bayesian estimation, but has
                   previously suffered from two problems. First, there has been
                   no systematic way of specifying a prior for the global
                   shrinkage hyperparameter based on the prior information
                   about the degree of sparsity in the parameter vector.
                   Second, the horseshoe prior has the undesired property that
                   there is no possibility of specifying separately information
                   about sparsity and the amount of regularization for the
                   largest coefficients, which can be problematic with weakly
                   identified parameters, such as the logistic regression
                   coefficients in the case of data separation. This paper
                   proposes solutions to both of these problems. We introduce a
                   concept of effective number of nonzero parameters, show an
                   intuitive way of formulating the prior for the global
                   hyperparameter based on the sparsity assumptions, and argue
                   that the previous default choices are dubious based on their
                   tendency to favor solutions with more unshrunk parameters
                   than we typically expect a priori. Moreover, we introduce a
                   generalization to the horseshoe prior, called the
                   regularized horseshoe, that allows us to specify a minimum
                   level of regularization to the largest values. We show that
                   the new prior can be considered as the continuous
                   counterpart of the spike-and-slab prior with a finite slab
                   width, whereas the original horseshoe resembles the
                   spike-and-slab with an infinitely wide slab. Numerical
                   experiments on synthetic and real world data illustrate the
                   benefit of both of these theoretical advances.",

              contact-precaution rooms from 9 acute-care hospitals and 2
              long-term care facilities in 4 states. PARTICIPANTS Samples from
              166 rooms (113 routine cleaned and 53 terminal cleaned rooms).
              METHODS Using a standard sponge-wipe sampling protocol, 2
              composite samples were collected from each room; a third sample
              was collected from each Clostridium difficile room. Composite 1
              included the TV remote, telephone, call button, and bed rails.
              Composite 2 included the room door handle, IV pole, and overbed
              table. Composite 3 included toileting surfaces. Total bacteria
              and MDROs (ie, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,
              vancomycin-resistant enterococci [VRE], Acinetobacter baumannii,
              Klebsiella pneumoniae, and C. difficile) were quantified,
              confirmed, and tested for drug resistance. RESULTS The mean
              microbial bioburden and range from routine cleaned room
              composites were higher (2,700 colony-forming units [CFU]/100 cm2;
              $\leq$1-130,000 CFU/100 cm2) than from terminal cleaned room
              composites (353 CFU/100 cm2; $\leq$1-4,300 CFU/100 cm2). MDROs
              were recovered from 34\% of routine cleaned room composites
              (range $\leq$1-13,000 CFU/100 cm2) and 17\% of terminal cleaned
              room composites ($\leq$1-524 CFU/100 cm2). MDROs were recovered

              This multicenter bioburden summary provides a first step to
              determining microbial bioburden on healthcare surfaces, which may

                   applicable information criterion (WAIC) are methods for
                   estimating pointwise out-of-sample prediction accuracy from
                   a fitted Bayesian model using the log-likelihood evaluated
                   at the posterior simulations of the parameter values. LOO
                   and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of
                   predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in
                   practice because they involve additional computational
                   steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO
                   and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation
                   draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using
                   Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure
                   for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is
                   asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is
                   more robust in the finite case with weak priors or
                   influential observations. As a byproduct of our
                   calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for

  author   = "Weber, David J and Anderson, Deverick and Rutala, William A",
  abstract = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article reviews the evidence
              demonstrating the importance of contamination of hospital
              surfaces in the transmission of healthcare-associated pathogens
              and interventions scientifically demonstrated to reduce the
              levels of microbial contamination and decrease
              healthcare-associated infections. RECENT FINDINGS: The
              contaminated surface environment in hospitals plays an important
              role in the transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
              aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. (VRE),
              Clostridium difficile, Acinetobacter spp., and norovirus.
              Improved surface cleaning and disinfection can reduce
              transmission of these pathogens. 'No-touch' methods of room
              disinfection (i.e., devices which produce ultraviolet light or
              hydrogen peroxide) and 'self-disinfecting' surfaces (e.g.,
              copper) also show promise to decrease contamination and reduce
              healthcare-associated infections. SUMMARY: Hospital surfaces are
              frequently contaminated with important healthcare-associated
              pathogens. Contact with the contaminated environment by
              healthcare personnel is equally as likely as direct contact with
              a patient to lead to contamination of the healthcare provider's
              hands or gloves that may result in patient-to-patient
              transmission of nosocomial pathogens. Admission to a room
              previously occupied by a patient with MRSA, VRE, Acinetobacter,
              or C. difficile increases the risk for the subsequent patient
              admitted to the room to acquire the pathogen. Improved cleaning
              and disinfection of room surfaces decreases the risk of
              healthcare-associated infections.",
